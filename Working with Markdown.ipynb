    "Markdown is a lightweight Markup language with a plain text syntax. John Gruber developed the Markdown language in 2004 in a collaborative effort with Aaron Swartz, intending to enable people to “write with easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format and potentially convert it to structurally correct XHTML (or HTML).” Markdown is designed to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.\n",
    "Nevertheless, Markdown is not a substitute for, or even close to, HTML. Its syntax is minimal, correlating only to a tiny proportion of HTML tags. Markdown’s idea is to make reading, writing, and editing prose easy without the intention to create a syntax that’s just for quickly adding HTML tags. HTML is a format for publishing, while Markdown is a format for reading. Therefore, the formatting syntax of Markdown tackles just issues that can be expressed in plain text. You simply use HTML for any Markup that is not covered by the Markdown syntax. You don’t need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you are switching from Markdown to HTML — you just use the tags.\n",
    "Among the data enthusiasts, Jupyter notebook is in trend. It is simple to use and helps you to create and share documents that include code, visualizations, and narration. Recall that a Jupyter Notebook is a series of cells that can store text or code. Cells shape a notebook’s core. Markdown Cells allows you to write and render Markdown syntax. Here’s where you can explain and document the processes. On the other hand, code cells allow you to write and run program code like Python.\n",

    "Note: The Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags but is processed within span-level tags.\n",
