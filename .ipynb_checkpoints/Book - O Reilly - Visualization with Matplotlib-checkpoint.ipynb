    "Chapter 4. Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "We’ll now take an in-depth look at the Matplotlib tool for visualization in Python. Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line. IPython’s creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003. It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib’s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large userbase, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age. Newer tools like ggplot and ggvis in the R language, along with web visualization toolkits based on D3js and HTML5 canvas, often make Matplotlib feel clunky and old-fashioned. Still, I’m of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib’s strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine. Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to set new global plotting styles (see “Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets”), and people have been developing new packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via cleaner, more modern APIs—for example, Seaborn (discussed in “Visualization with Seaborn”), ggplot, HoloViews, Altair, and even Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around Matplotlib’s API. Even with wrappers like these, it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib’s syntax to adjust the final plot output. For this reason, I believe that Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from using the Matplotlib API directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Matplotlib Tips\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of creating visualizations with Matplotlib, there are a few useful things you should know about using the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing matplotlib\n",
    "Just as we use the np shorthand for NumPy and the pd shorthand for Pandas, we will use some standard shorthands for Matplotlib imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[1]: import matplotlib as mpl\n",
    "       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "The plt interface is what we will use most often, as we’ll see throughout this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Styles\n",
    "We will use the plt.style directive to choose appropriate aesthetic styles for our figures. Here we will set the classic style, which ensures that the plots we create use the classic Matplotlib style:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[2]: plt.style.use('classic')\n",
    "Throughout this section, we will adjust this style as needed. Note that the stylesheets used here are supported as of Matplotlib version 1.5; if you are using an earlier version of Matplotlib, only the default style is available. For more information on stylesheets, see “Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets”.\n",
    "\n",
    "show() or No show()? How to Display Your Plots\n",
    "A visualization you can’t see won’t be of much use, but just how you view your Matplotlib plots depends on the context. The best use of Matplotlib differs depending on how you are using it; roughly, the three applicable contexts are using Matplotlib in a script, in an IPython terminal, or in an IPython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting from a script\n",
    "If you are using Matplotlib from within a script, the function plt.show() is your friend. plt.show() starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, you may have a file called myplot.py containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ------- file: myplot.py ------\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "You can then run this script from the command-line prompt, which will result in a window opening with your figure displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ python myplot.py\n",
    "The plt.show() command does a lot under the hood, as it must interact with your system’s interactive graphical backend. The details of this operation can vary greatly from system to system and even installation to installation, but Matplotlib does its best to hide all these details from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be aware of: the plt.show() command should be used only once per Python session, and is most often seen at the very end of the script. Multiple show() commands can lead to unpredictable backend-dependent behavior, and should mostly be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting from an IPython shell\n",
    "It can be very convenient to use Matplotlib interactively within an IPython shell (see Chapter 1). IPython is built to work well with Matplotlib if you specify Matplotlib mode. To enable this mode, you can use the %matplotlib magic command after starting ipython:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1]: %matplotlib\n",
    "Using matplotlib backend: TkAgg\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "At this point, any plt plot command will cause a figure window to open, and further commands can be run to update the plot. Some changes (such as modifying properties of lines that are already drawn) will not draw automatically; to force an update, use plt.draw(). Using plt.show() in Matplotlib mode is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting from an IPython notebook\n",
    "The IPython notebook is a browser-based interactive data analysis tool that can combine narrative, code, graphics, HTML elements, and much more into a single executable document (see Chapter 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting interactively within an IPython notebook can be done with the %matplotlib command, and works in a similar way to the IPython shell. In the IPython notebook, you also have the option of embedding graphics directly in the notebook, with two possible options:\n",
    "\n",
    "%matplotlib notebook will lead to interactive plots embedded within the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "%matplotlib inline will lead to static images of your plot embedded in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For this book, we will generally opt for %matplotlib inline:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[3]: %matplotlib inline\n",
    "After you run this command (it needs to be done only once per kernel/session), any cell within the notebook that creates a plot will embed a PNG image of the resulting graphic (Figure 4-1):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[4]: import numpy as np\n",
    "       x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "       fig = plt.figure()\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), '-')\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, np.cos(x), '--');\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-1. Basic plotting example\n",
    "Saving Figures to File\n",
    "One nice feature of Matplotlib is the ability to save figures in a wide variety of formats. You can save a figure using the savefig() command. For example, to save the previous figure as a PNG file, you can run this:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[5]: fig.savefig('my_figure.png')\n",
    "We now have a file called my_figure.png in the current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[6]: !ls -lh my_figure.png\n",
    "-rw-r--r--  1 jakevdp  staff    16K Aug 11 10:59 my_figure.png\n",
    "To confirm that it contains what we think it contains, let’s use the IPython Image object to display the contents of this file (Figure 4-2):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[7]: from IPython.display import Image\n",
    "       Image('my_figure.png')\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-2. PNG rendering of the basic plot\n",
    "In savefig(), the file format is inferred from the extension of the given filename. Depending on what backends you have installed, many different file formats are available. You can find the list of supported file types for your system by using the following method of the figure canvas object:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[8]: fig.canvas.get_supported_filetypes()\n",
    "Out[8]: {'eps': 'Encapsulated Postscript',\n",

    "Note that when saving your figure, it’s not necessary to use plt.show() or related commands discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Interfaces for the Price of One\n",
    "A potentially confusing feature of Matplotlib is its dual interfaces: a convenient MATLAB-style state-based interface, and a more powerful object-oriented interface. We’ll quickly highlight the differences between the two here.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB-style interface\n",
    "Matplotlib was originally written as a Python alternative for MATLAB users, and much of its syntax reflects that fact. The MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (plt) interface. For example, the following code will probably look quite familiar to MATLAB users (Figure 4-3):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[9]: plt.figure()  # create a plot figure\n",
    "\n",
    "       # create the first of two panels and set current axis\n",
    "       plt.subplot(2, 1, 1) # (rows, columns, panel number)\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "       # create the second panel and set current axis\n",
    "       plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, np.cos(x));\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-3. Subplots using the MATLAB-style interface\n",
    "It’s important to note that this interface is stateful: it keeps track of the “current” figure and axes, which are where all plt commands are applied. You can get a reference to these using the plt.gcf() (get current figure) and plt.gca() (get current axes) routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this stateful interface is fast and convenient for simple plots, it is easy to run into problems. For example, once the second panel is created, how can we go back and add something to the first? This is possible within the MATLAB-style interface, but a bit clunky. Fortunately, there is a better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented interface\n",
    "The object-oriented interface is available for these more complicated situations, and for when you want more control over your figure. Rather than depending on some notion of an “active” figure or axes, in the object-oriented interface the plotting functions are methods of explicit Figure and Axes objects. To re-create the previous plot using this style of plotting, you might do the following (Figure 4-4):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[10]: # First create a grid of plots\n",
    "        # ax will be an array of two Axes objects\n",
    "        fig, ax = plt.subplots(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Call plot() method on the appropriate object\n",
    "        ax[0].plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "        ax[1].plot(x, np.cos(x));\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-4. Subplots using the object-oriented interface\n",
    "For more simple plots, the choice of which style to use is largely a matter of preference, but the object-oriented approach can become a necessity as plots become more complicated. Throughout this chapter, we will switch between the MATLAB-style and object-oriented interfaces, depending on what is most convenient. In most cases, the difference is as small as switching plt.plot() to ax.plot(), but there are a few gotchas that we will highlight as they come up in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Line Plots\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest of all plots is the visualization of a single function y = f ( x ) . Here we will take a first look at creating a simple plot of this type. As with all the following sections, we’ll start by setting up the notebook for plotting and importing the functions we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "In[1]: %matplotlib inline\n",
    "       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "       plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')\n",
    "       import numpy as np\n",
    "For all Matplotlib plots, we start by creating a figure and an axes. In their simplest form, a figure and axes can be created as follows (Figure 4-5):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[2]: fig = plt.figure()\n",
    "       ax = plt.axes()\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-5. An empty gridded axes\n",
    "In Matplotlib, the figure (an instance of the class plt.Figure) can be thought of as a single container that contains all the objects representing axes, graphics, text, and labels. The axes (an instance of the class plt.Axes) is what we see above: a bounding box with ticks and labels, which will eventually contain the plot elements that make up our visualization. Throughout this book, we’ll commonly use the variable name fig to refer to a figure instance, and ax to refer to an axes instance or group of axes instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created an axes, we can use the ax.plot function to plot some data. Let’s start with a simple sinusoid (Figure 4-6):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[3]: fig = plt.figure()\n",
    "       ax = plt.axes()\n",
    "\n",
    "       x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)\n",
    "       ax.plot(x, np.sin(x));\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-6. A simple sinusoid\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use the pylab interface and let the figure and axes be created for us in the background (Figure 4-7; see “Two Interfaces for the Price of One” for a discussion of these two interfaces):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[4]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x));\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-7. A simple sinusoid via the object-oriented interface\n",
    "If we want to create a single figure with multiple lines, we can simply call the plot function multiple times (Figure 4-8):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[5]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, np.cos(x));\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-8. Over-plotting multiple lines\n",
    "That’s all there is to plotting simple functions in Matplotlib! We’ll now dive into some more details about how to control the appearance of the axes and lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the Plot: Line Colors and Styles\n",
    "The first adjustment you might wish to make to a plot is to control the line colors and styles. The plt.plot() function takes additional arguments that can be used to specify these. To adjust the color, you can use the color keyword, which accepts a string argument representing virtually any imaginable color. The color can be specified in a variety of ways (Figure 4-9):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[6]:\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 0), color='blue')        # specify color by name\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 1), color='g')           # short color code (rgbcmyk)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 2), color='0.75')        # Grayscale between 0 and 1\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 3), color='#FFDD44')     # Hex code (RRGGBB from 00 to FF)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 4), color=(1.0,0.2,0.3)) # RGB tuple, values 0 and 1\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x - 5), color='chartreuse'); # all HTML color names supported\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-9. Controlling the color of plot elements\n",
    "If no color is specified, Matplotlib will automatically cycle through a set of default colors for multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can adjust the line style using the linestyle keyword (Figure 4-10):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[7]: plt.plot(x, x + 0, linestyle='solid')\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 1, linestyle='dashed')\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 2, linestyle='dashdot')\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 3, linestyle='dotted');\n",
    "\n",
    "       # For short, you can use the following codes:\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 4, linestyle='-')  # solid\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 5, linestyle='--') # dashed\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 6, linestyle='-.') # dashdot\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 7, linestyle=':');  # dotted\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-10. Example of various line styles\n",
    "If you would like to be extremely terse, these linestyle and color codes can be combined into a single nonkeyword argument to the plt.plot() function (Figure 4-11):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[8]: plt.plot(x, x + 0, '-g')  # solid green\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 1, '--c') # dashed cyan\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 2, '-.k') # dashdot black\n",
    "       plt.plot(x, x + 3, ':r');  # dotted red\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-11. Controlling colors and styles with the shorthand syntax\n",
    "These single-character color codes reflect the standard abbreviations in the RGB (Red/Green/Blue) and CMYK (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/blacK) color systems, commonly used for digital color graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other keyword arguments that can be used to fine-tune the appearance of the plot; for more details, I’d suggest viewing the docstring of the plt.plot() function using IPython’s help tools (see “Help and Documentation in IPython”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the Plot: Axes Limits\n",
    "Matplotlib does a decent job of choosing default axes limits for your plot, but sometimes it’s nice to have finer control. The most basic way to adjust axis limits is to use the plt.xlim() and plt.ylim() methods (Figure 4-12):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[9]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "       plt.xlim(-1, 11)\n",
    "       plt.ylim(-1.5, 1.5);\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-12. Example of setting axis limits\n",
    "If for some reason you’d like either axis to be displayed in reverse, you can simply reverse the order of the arguments (Figure 4-13):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[10]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "        plt.xlim(10, 0)\n",
    "        plt.ylim(1.2, -1.2);\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-13. Example of reversing the y-axis\n",
    "A useful related method is plt.axis() (note here the potential confusion between axes with an e, and axis with an i). The plt.axis() method allows you to set the x and y limits with a single call, by passing a list that specifies [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] (Figure 4-14):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[11]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "        plt.axis([-1, 11, -1.5, 1.5]);\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-14. Setting the axis limits with plt.axis\n",
    "The plt.axis() method goes even beyond this, allowing you to do things like automatically tighten the bounds around the current plot (Figure 4-15):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[12]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "        plt.axis('tight');\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-15. Example of a “tight” layout\n",
    "It allows even higher-level specifications, such as ensuring an equal aspect ratio so that on your screen, one unit in x is equal to one unit in y (Figure 4-16):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[13]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "        plt.axis('equal');\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-16. Example of an “equal” layout, with units matched to the output resolution\n",
    "For more information on axis limits and the other capabilities of the plt.axis() method, refer to the plt.axis() docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labeling Plots\n",
    "As the last piece of this section, we’ll briefly look at the labeling of plots: titles, axis labels, and simple legends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles and axis labels are the simplest such labels—there are methods that can be used to quickly set them (Figure 4-17):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[14]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "        plt.title(\"A Sine Curve\")\n",
    "        plt.xlabel(\"x\")\n",
    "        plt.ylabel(\"sin(x)\");\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-17. Examples of axis labels and title\n",
    "You can adjust the position, size, and style of these labels using optional arguments to the function. For more information, see the Matplotlib documentation and the docstrings of each of these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple lines are being shown within a single axes, it can be useful to create a plot legend that labels each line type. Again, Matplotlib has a built-in way of quickly creating such a legend. It is done via the (you guessed it) plt.legend() method. Though there are several valid ways of using this, I find it easiest to specify the label of each line using the label keyword of the plot function (Figure 4-18):\n",
    "\n",
    "In[15]: plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), '-g', label='sin(x)')\n",
    "        plt.plot(x, np.cos(x), ':b', label='cos(x)')\n",
    "        plt.axis('equal')\n",
    "\n",
    "        plt.legend();\n",
    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-18. Plot legend example\n",
    "As you can see, the plt.legend() function keeps track of the line style and color, and matches these with the correct label. More information on specifying and formatting plot legends can be found in the plt.legend() docstring; additionally, we will cover some more advanced legend options in “Customizing Plot Legends”.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATPLOTLIB GOTCHAS\n",
    "While most plt functions translate directly to ax methods (such as plt.plot() → ax.plot(), plt.legend() → ax.legend(), etc.), this is not the case for all commands. In particular, functions to set limits, labels, and titles are slightly modified. For transitioning between MATLAB-style functions and object-oriented methods, make the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.xlabel() → ax.set_xlabel()\n",

While it doesn’t matter as much for small amounts of data, as datasets get larger than a few thousand points, plt.plot can be noticeably more efficient than plt.scatter. The reason is that plt.scatter has the capability to render a different size and/or color for each point, so the renderer must do the extra work of constructing each point individually. In plt.plot, on the other hand, the points are always essentially clones of each other, so the work of determining the appearance of the points is done only once for the entire set of data. For large datasets, the difference between these two can lead to vastly different performance, and for this reason, plt.plot should be preferred over plt.scatter for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing Errors\n",
    "For any scientific measurement, accurate accounting for errors is nearly as important, if not more important, than accurate reporting of the number itself. For example, imagine that I am using some astrophysical observations to estimate the Hubble Constant, the local measurement of the expansion rate of the universe. I know that the current literature suggests a value of around 71 (km/s)/Mpc, and I measure a value of 74 (km/s)/Mpc with my method. Are the values consistent? The only correct answer, given this information, is this: there is no way to know.\n",

    "Sometimes it is helpful to compare different views of data side by side. To this end, Matplotlib has the concept of subplots: groups of smaller axes that can exist together within a single figure. These subplots might be insets, grids of plots, or other more complicated layouts. In this section, we’ll explore four routines for creating subplots in Matplotlib. We’ll start by setting up the notebook for plotting and importing the functions we will use:\n",

    "The most basic method of creating an axes is to use the plt.axes function. As we’ve seen previously, by default this creates a standard axes object that fills the entire figure. plt.axes also takes an optional argument that is a list of four numbers in the figure coordinate system. These numbers represent [bottom, left, width, height] in the figure coordinate system, which ranges from 0 at the bottom left of the figure to 1 at the top right of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might create an inset axes at the top-right corner of another axes by setting the x and y position to 0.65 (that is, starting at 65% of the width and 65% of the height of the figure) and the x and y extents to 0.2 (that is, the size of the axes is 20% of the width and 20% of the height of the figure).

For this purpose, plt.subplots() is the easier tool to use (note the s at the end of subplots). Rather than creating a single subplot, this function creates a full grid of subplots in a single line, returning them in a NumPy array.

    "Customizing Ticks\n",
    "Matplotlib’s default tick locators and formatters are designed to be generally sufficient in many common situations, but are in no way optimal for every plot. This section will give several examples of adjusting the tick locations and formatting for the particular plot type you’re interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into examples, it will be best for us to understand further the object hierarchy of Matplotlib plots. Matplotlib aims to have a Python object representing everything that appears on the plot: for example, recall that the figure is the bounding box within which plot elements appear. Each Matplotlib object can also act as a container of sub-objects; for example, each figure can contain one or more axes objects, each of which in turn contain other objects representing plot contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tick marks are no exception. Each axes has attributes xaxis and yaxis, which in turn have attributes that contain all the properties of the lines, ticks, and labels that make up the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major and Minor Ticks\n",
    "Within each axis, there is the concept of a major tick mark and a minor tick mark. As the names would imply, major ticks are usually bigger or more pronounced, while minor ticks are usually smaller. By default, Matplotlib rarely makes use of minor ticks, but one place you can see them is within logarithmic plots (Figure 4-73):\n",
    "\n",

    "Figure 4-73. Example of logarithmic scales and labels\n",
    "We see here that each major tick shows a large tick mark and a label, while each minor tick shows a smaller tick mark with no label.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can customize these tick properties—that is, locations and labels—by setting the formatter and locator objects of each axis. Let’s examine these for the x axis of the plot just shown:\n",
    "\n",

    "<matplotlib.ticker.NullFormatter object at 0x10752dc18>\n",
    "We see that both major and minor tick labels have their locations specified by a LogLocator (which makes sense for a logarithmic plot). Minor ticks, though, have their labels formatted by a NullFormatter; this says that no labels will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll now show a few examples of setting these locators and formatters for various plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiding Ticks or Labels\n",
    "Perhaps the most common tick/label formatting operation is the act of hiding ticks or labels. We can do this using plt.NullLocator() and plt.NullFormatter(), as shown here (Figure 4-74):\n",
    "\n",

    "Notice that we’ve removed the labels (but kept the ticks/gridlines) from the x axis, and removed the ticks (and thus the labels as well) from the y axis. Having no ticks at all can be useful in many situations—for example, when you want to show a grid of images. For instance, consider Figure 4-75, which includes images of different faces, an example often used in supervised machine learning problems (for more information, see “In-Depth: Support Vector Machines”):\n",

    "Particularly for the x ticks, the numbers nearly overlap, making them quite difficult to decipher. We can fix this with the plt.MaxNLocator(), which allows us to specify the maximum number of ticks that will be displayed. Given this maximum number, Matplotlib will use internal logic to choose the particular tick locations (Figure 4-77):\n",

    "\n",
    "Fancy Tick Formats\n",
    "Matplotlib’s default tick formatting can leave a lot to be desired; it works well as a broad default, but sometimes you’d like to do something more. Consider the plot shown in Figure 4-78, a sine and a cosine:\n",
    "\n",

    "png\n",
    "Figure 4-78. A default plot with integer ticks\n",
    "There are a couple changes we might like to make. First, it’s more natural for this data to space the ticks and grid lines in multiples of π . We can do this by setting a MultipleLocator, which locates ticks at a multiple of the number you provide. For good measure, we’ll add both major and minor ticks in multiples of π / 4 (Figure 4-79):\n",

There’s no built-in formatter for what we want to do, so we’ll instead use plt.FuncFormatter, which accepts a user-defined function giving fine-grained control over the tick outputs (Figure 4-80):\n",

Here we will visualize such an object using Matplotlib’s three-dimensional tools. The key to creating the Möbius strip is to think about its parameterization: it’s a two-dimensional strip, so we need two intrinsic dimensions. Let’s call them θ , which ranges from 0 to 2 π around the loop, and w which ranges from –1 to 1 across the width of the strip:\n",

    "Thinking about it, we might realize that there are two rotations happening: one is the position of the loop about its center (what we’ve called θ ), while the other is the twisting of the strip about its axis (we’ll call this ϕ ). For a Möbius strip, we must have the strip make half a twist during a full loop, or Δ ϕ = Δ θ / 2 .\n",

    "Finally, to plot the object, we must make sure the triangulation is correct. The best way to do this is to define the triangulation within the underlying parameterization, and then let Matplotlib project this triangulation into the three-dimensional space of the Möbius strip. This can be accomplished as follows (Figure 4-101):\n",

Matplotlib’s main tool for this type of visualization is the Basemap toolkit, which is one of several Matplotlib toolkits that live under the mpl_toolkits namespace. Admittedly, Basemap feels a bit clunky to use, and often even simple visualizations take much longer to render than you might hope. More modern solutions, such as leaflet or the Google Maps API, may be a better choice for more intensive map visualizations. Still, Basemap is a useful tool for Python users to have in their virtual toolbelts. In this section, we’ll show several examples of the type of map visualization that is possible with this toolkit.\n",

This type of mapping represents equatorial regions quite well, but results in extreme distortions near the poles. The spacing of latitude lines varies between different cylindrical projections, leading to different conservation properties, and different distortion near the poles. In Figure 4-104, we show an example of the equidistant cylindrical projection, which chooses a latitude scaling that preserves distances along meridians. Other cylindrical projections are the Mercator (projection='merc') and the cylindrical equal-area (projection='cea') projections.\n",

The Mollweide projection (projection='moll') is one common example of this, in which all meridians are elliptical arcs (Figure 4-105). It is constructed so as to preserve area across the map: though there are distortions near the poles, the area of small patches reflects the true area.

One common example is the orthographic projection (projection='ortho'), which shows one side of the globe as seen from a viewer at a very long distance. Thus, it can show only half the globe at a time. Other perspective-based projections include the gnomonic projection (projection='gnom') and stereographic projection (projection='stere').

    "A conic projection projects the map onto a single cone, which is then unrolled. This can lead to very good local properties, but regions far from the focus point of the cone may become very distorted. One example of this is the Lambert conformal conic projection (projection='lcc'), which we saw earlier in the map of North America. It projects the map onto a cone arranged in such a way that two standard parallels (specified in Basemap by lat_1 and lat_2) have well-represented distances, with scale decreasing between them and increasing outside of them. Other useful conic projections are the equidistant conic (projection='eqdc') and the Albers equal-area (projection='aea') projection (Figure 4-107). Conic projections, like perspective projections, tend to be good choices for representing small to medium patches of the globe.\n",

    "Visualization with Seaborn\n",
    "Matplotlib has proven to be an incredibly useful and popular visualization tool, but even avid users will admit it often leaves much to be desired. There are several valid complaints about Matplotlib that often come up:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to version 2.0, Matplotlib’s defaults are not exactly the best choices. It was based off of MATLAB circa 1999, and this often shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib’s API is relatively low level. Doing sophisticated statistical visualization is possible, but often requires a lot of boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib predated Pandas by more than a decade, and thus is not designed for use with Pandas DataFrames. In order to visualize data from a Pandas DataFrame, you must extract each Series and often concatenate them together into the right format. It would be nicer to have a plotting library that can intelligently use the DataFrame labels in a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "An answer to these problems is Seaborn. Seaborn provides an API on top of Matplotlib that offers sane choices for plot style and color defaults, defines simple high-level functions for common statistical plot types, and integrates with the functionality provided by Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, the Matplotlib team is addressing this: it has recently added the plt.style tools (discussed in “Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets”), and is starting to handle Pandas data more seamlessly. The 2.0 release of the library will include a new default stylesheet that will improve on the current status quo. But for all the reasons just discussed, Seaborn remains an extremely useful add-on.\n",

    "Now let’s take a look at how it works with Seaborn. As we will see, Seaborn has many of its own high-level plotting routines, but it can also overwrite Matplotlib’s default parameters and in turn get even simple Matplotlib scripts to produce vastly superior output.

In addition, Matplotlib’s online documentation can be a helpful reference. See in particular the Matplotlib gallery linked on that page: it shows thumbnails of hundreds of different plot types, each one linked to a page with the Python code snippet used to generate it. In this way, you can visually inspect and learn about a wide range of different plotting styles and visualization techniques.\n",

The reference rendering implementation is JavaScript, but the API is language agnostic. There is a Python API under development in the Altair package. Though it’s not mature yet, I’m quite excited for the possibilities of this project to provide a common reference point for visualization in Python and other languages.\n",
